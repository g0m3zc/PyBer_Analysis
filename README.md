# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis for testing data using Pandas &amp; Jupiter Notebook, and matplotlib


## Project Overview
Overview of the ride data analysis
This project consisted of providing an analysis of ride sharing data.  The intent is to view fares by city type by week.  The intent is to see how the data differs by each city type.  Finally, recommendations can be shared with the decisionmakers at PyBer.  The steps included:
1.  Use the groupby method to determine information by type of city for totals and averages on the different datapoints.
2.  Create a dataframe that views this information by type of city.
3.  Use the groupby method to determine information by week.
4.  Plot the information over time to view differences and similarities of the total fair based on types of city over time.


## Resources
- a.csv
- Pandas
- Jupiter Notebook
- Matplotlib

## Results

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type
