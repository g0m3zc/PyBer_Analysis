# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis for testing data using Pandas &amp; Jupiter Notebook, and Matplotlib.


## Project Overview
Overview of the ride data analysis
This project consisted of providing an analysis of ride sharing data.  The intent is to view fares by city type by week.  The intent is to see how the data differs by each city type.  Finally, recommendations can be shared with the decisionmakers at PyBer.  The steps included:
1.  Use the groupby method to determine information by type of city for totals and averages on the different datapoints.
2.  Create a dataframe that views this information by type of city.
3.  Use the groupby method to determine information by week.
4.  Plot the information over time to view differences and similarities of the total fair based on types of city over time.


## Resources
- Pandas
- Jupiter Notebook
- Matplotlib

## Results


Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type
The table below has a comparision of the metrics for rides based on type of city.  In general, Urban has the most rides, drivers, and total fares compared to Suburban and Rural cities.  Rural drivers typically make a higher average fare per ride as well as a higher average fare per driver.  The total fair by city type over time is also consistent with this trend.

## Summary:
Possible business recommendations for addressing the differences among the city types would include
- Identifying ways to recruit drivers and rides in the rural or suburban areas.
- Promoting drivers in urban areas near Urban cities to accept rides in the Suburban areas. This could move the workforce toward higher fare work without changing the number of drivers.
- Identifying if there are ways to be more profitable in the Urban area to compensate for the lower average fare per driver.
provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
